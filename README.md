# Single-Player-Simon-Game
A recreated version of the Simon electronic memory skill game, invented in 1978 by Ralph H.Baer and Howard J. Morrison.</br>
This project uses **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. 

## Instructions 
- Press the START button to switch on the game. The game status indicator should turn from red to green.</br>
- Simon will give the first signal (randomly flash a coloured button). Repeat the signal by clicking the same colour button.</br>
- Simon will then duplicate the first signal and add another. Repeat these two signals by clicking the same colour buttons, in order.</br>
- Continue this process. Once the the game reaches to the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, it automatically speeds up.</br>
- If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take longer than five seconds, Simon responds by flashing all four buttons simultaneously five times indicating that you lost the game.</br>
- Your score is displayed on the right side of the START button, while the all-time highest score is shown on the left.</br>
